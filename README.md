## Quick Intro

I know it may be silly to do this with Pok√©mon, but I tend to enjoy using Pok√©mon as a demo app. A lot of good information to work with, and it contains a lot of interesting ways to filter and search.

I chose to leave more color out of the app, and focus on the core functionality. I didnt want colors to distract and give off a messy feeling overall. I had the pokemon cards colored to be specific to the pokemon type, same with filter buttons, but it was too much. I also wanted to keep the design simple, so I didnt use a lot of fancy animations or transitions.
